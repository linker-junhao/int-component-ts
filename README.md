# INT-COMPONENT-TS

## intro
basically, this project is just for fun and collect some component/code used in daily dev work.

Not all code would be published to npm, just the part that I can ensure ok to use in dev will be published.

ok, that's all. rest of this readme is the usage doc of the component that I published. if you don't want to taste my terrible english, you can also clone this project to your machine and run the example part. 

## components
### [drag-drop](https://github.com/linkerGitHub/int-component-ts/blob/master/components/drag-drop/README.md)

## other
* RUN EXAMPLE: run example with command `npm run vite:dev-example`
* SLOW DOWNLOADING SPEED: I used `.npmrc` to get faster packaged download speed. if you encountered slow downloading speed, you can delete the file or change the config in the file.
