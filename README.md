# INT-COMPONENT-TS
basically, this project is just for fun and collect some component/code used in daily dev work.

Not all code would be published to npm, just the part that I can ensure ok to use in dev will be published.

ok, that's all. rest of this readme is the usage doc of the component that I published. if you don't want to taste my terrible english, you can also clone this project to your machine and run the example part.
